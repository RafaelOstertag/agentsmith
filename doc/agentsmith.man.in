.\"=========================================================
.\" DESCRIPTION
.\"=========================================================
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B @PACKAGE@
is a daemon that continuously monitors a log file for break\-in attempts by
remote hosts. Upon detection of a break\-in attempt, it launches a user defined
script or application.
.P
The criteria what is considered a break-in attempt can be configured by means
of a regular expression. See @PACKAGE@.conf(@FILE_SECTION@) for further
information on this.
.\"=========================================================
.\" OPTIONS
.\"=========================================================
.SH OPTIONS
The following options are supported:
.\"
.TP 5
\fB\-c\fR \fIconfigfile\fR
File path of the configuration file to use. If not specified, the default
@DEFAULT_CONFIGFILE@ is used. See also @PACKAGE@.conf(@FILE_SECTION@).
.TP
\fB\-p\fR \fIpidfile\fR
File path of the file where the PID of the daemon will be written to. If not
specified, the default @DEFAULT_PIDFILE@ is used.
.TP
.B \-d
Do not fork to background but stay in foreground. Most useful for debugging.
.TP
.B \-h
Show a brief help of the supported options.
.TP
.B \-t
Check the configuration file and regular expression, and exit.
.TP
.B \-L
Show the license and exit.
.TP
.B \-V
Show the version and exit.
.\"=========================================================
.\" USAGE
.\"=========================================================
.SH USAGE
.B @PACKAGE@
reads the configuration at the default location (see FILES) or
at the location provided with the
.B -c
option when started. It is recommended to launch
.B @PACKAGE@
with the
.B -t
option specified after the configuration has been altered in order to identify
possible configuration errors.
.P
After successful start
.B @PACKAGE@
will fork to background (unless the
.B -d
option is provided) and monitor the log file specified in the configuration
file. It will only read new lines added to the log file. Lines present in the
log file prior starting
.B @PACKAGE@
are ignored.
.P
Each new line added to the log file will be matched against the regular
expression. If a line matches,
.B @PACKAGE@
will read the value from the catching expression which has to be a host IP
address (hereafter called ``offending host''). The offending host will then be
remembered by
.B @PACKAGE@.
If the offending host exceeds the configured threshold of occurrences within
a specified time span, the action script will be called.
.P
The action script is only called once for each offending host that meets the above
mentioned criteria.
.P
However, the last seen time stamp will be updated regardless, for each further occurrence of the
offending host after the action script has been called.
.P
If an IP address remembered by
.B @PACKAGE@
is not seen for a specified amount of time, the action script will be called
again and the offending host will be purged from memory.
.P
.B @PACKAGE@
uses no persistent storage for storing offending hosts, thus the information is
only kept during the run-time of the process and is lost upon termination.
.\"== Action Script
.SS Action Script
The action script is called in two cases:
.TP 5
1)
.\"
An offending host has triggered the action script as explained above. The
script will be invoked by
.B @PACKAGE@
with the following arguments:
.sp 1
.ti 20
.nf
<\fIipaddress\fR> <\fIoccurrences\fR> new <\fIsender\fR>
.fi
.sp 1
<\fIipaddress\fR> is the IP address of the offending host, i.e. the IP address
that has been caught by the regular expression. <\fIoccurrences\fR> is the
number of occurrences. The literal word 'new' is used to indicate that the call
of the action script is for a new host. <\fIsender\fR> is the origin of the
offending host, i.e. the instance of
.B @PACKAGE@
that encountered the offending host (see Networking).
.TP
2)
.\" 
An offending host entry will be purged from memory, due to user request or
because it has expired. In either case, the script will be invoked with the
following arguments:
.sp 1
.ti 20
.nf
<\fIipaddress\fR> <\fIoccurrences\fR> remove <\fIsender\fR>
.fi
.sp 1
<\fIipaddress\fR>, <\fIoccurrences\fR>, and <\fIsender\fR> are the same as in
case 1) however <\fIoccurrences\fR> may be higher. The literal word 'remove' is
used to indicate that the offending host will be purged from memory.
.P
The action script is the corner stone of 
.B @PACKAGE@.
You are completely free to put whatever you suits in this file, e.g. commands
for updating firewall rules, for sending mails, and so on.
.P
It is important that the execution bit is set (see also chmod(1)) and
.B @PACKAGE@
has read and execution access to the file.
.\"=========================================================
.\" Networking
.\"=========================================================
.SS Networking
.B @PACKAGE@
can exchange information on offending hosts with instances running on remote
hosts and thus trigger remote action scripts.
.P
In order to provide authentication and prevent unauthorized access
.B @PACKAGE@
employs OpenSSL.
.B @PACKAGE@
will only exchange information with a another instance if both sides can verify
the certificate of the peer. 
.\"== Inform Mode
.TP 5
.B Inform Mode
In inform mode
.B @PACKAGE@
can inform other
.B @PACKAGE@
instances running on remote hosts of offending hosts detected. It will,
however, not inform remote instances when offending hosts are purged from
memory. Further,
.B @PACKAGE@
informs other instances only if the offending host triggers the action script,
any further occurrence of the offending host will not passed on to remote
instances.
.br
It is possible to specify several
.B @PACKAGE@
instances to be informed about offending hosts.
.\"== Server Mode
.TP
.B Server Mode
.B @PACKAGE@
can receive offending hosts to block from remote
.B @PACKAGE@
instances. Upon receiving offending host informations from remote instances, the action script
of the receiving
.B @PACKAGE@
will be called.
.br
.B @PACKAGE@
can be configured to check remotely received offending hosts for exclusion, or
to ignore the local exclusion list.
.P
It is possible to run
.B @PACKAGE@
in both modes simultaneously.
.\"=========================================================
.\" CONFIGURATION
.\"=========================================================
.SH CONFIGURATION
.B @PACKAGE@
relies on a configuration file for proper operation. The default location of
the configuration file is @DEFAULT_CONFIGFILE@. Please see
@PACKAGE@.conf(@FILE_SECTION@) for further information about how to configure
.B @PACKAGE@.
.\"=========================================================
.\" LOGGING
.\"=========================================================
.SH LOGGING
The logging facility used by
.B @PACKAGE@
is
.B daemon.
Regular messages are sent to
.B daemon.info.
Error messages are sent to
.B daemon.error.
If
.B @PACKAGE@
is compiled with debug code, debug messages are sent to
.B daemon.debug.
.P
You may need to adjust the configuration of the system logger in order to catch
all messages from
.B @PACKAGE@.
Please refer to syslog.conf(@FILE_SECTION@) or your System Manual.
.\"=========================================================
.\" SIGNALS
.\"=========================================================
.SH SIGNALS
Following signals are recognized (see also kill(1)):
.TP 5
.I SIGHUP
If an exclude file has been specified (see also
@PACKAGE@_exclude(@FILE_SECTION@)), its content will be re-read.
.TP
.I SIGUSR1
Request the list of offending hosts. It will be printed to the system log (see
also LOGGING).
.TP
.I SIGUSR2
Request that all offending hosts are purged from memory. This will also call
the action script with the 'remove' option.
.TP
.I SIGTERM
Terminate
.B @PACKAGE@
gracefully.
.\"=========================================================
.\" FILES
.\"=========================================================
.SH FILES
.TP 5
.I @DEFAULT_PIDFILE@
The default file path of the PID file. Can be overridden with the
.B -p
option.
.TP
.I @DEFAULT_CONFIGFILE@
The default location of the configuration file. Can be overridden with the
.B -c
option.
.\"=========================================================
.\" CAVEATS
.\"=========================================================
.SH CAVEATS
.TP
*
Although calling
.B @PACKAGE@
with the
.B -t
option shows no error, it is possible that
.B @PACKAGE@
does not start because it cannot write the PID file. Please make sure you check
the system log after starting
.B @PACKAGE@
as daemon to make sure it started successfully.
.TP
*
If started as root,
.B @PACKAGE@
does not drop root privileges.
.TP
*
.B @PACKAGE@
has to be started from an user account with read access to the specified log
file, else
.B @PACKAGE@
is unable to read the log file and cannot start.
.TP
*
Support for IPv6 addresses is implemented but not tested.
.TP
*
If the log file is removed during the operation of
.B @PACKAGE@,
it will repeatedly suspend for 30 seconds until the file reappears.
