# This is the configuration file for @PACKAGE@
#
# Comments start with '#'. Comments are only allowed at the start of the line.
# Configuration options ARE CASE-SENSITIVE.  Spaces between the configuration
# option and the equal sign ('=') are not allowed. E.g.:
#
# foo = bar
# foo= bar
# foo =bar
#
# are not allowed. The only way to do it is like this
#
# foo=bar
#
# If you run @PACKAGE@ with the -t switch, it will check the configuration and
# the regular expression. So, it is always a good idea to use -t switch after
# modifying the configuration file.

# The location of the PID file
pidfile=@DEFAULT_PIDFILE@

# The log file to monitor for break-in attempts.
syslogfile=/var/log/authlog

# How many occurrences in the log file before the action kicks in
#
# Default: 3
action_threshold=3

# Maximum time between subsequent matches in seconds. 'action_threshold'
# occurrences of break-in attempts have to happen within this time interval
#
# Default: 60
time_interval=60

# Remove host records after this many seconds have elapsed (this should
# obviously be a value greater than time_interval)
#
# Default: 3600
purge_after=3600

# This file contains the IP addresses and ranges to be excluded. All addresses
# listed will be ignored, and the action scrIPt will not be called.
#
# Default: none
#exclude=@sysconfdir@/@PACKAGE@/exclude

# Enable the server mode. In server mode, @PACKAGE@ allows other @PACKAGE@
# daemons to update the local deny list.
#
# 0 - disable the listening
# 1 - enable listening
#
# Default: 0

# The maximum concurrent connections allowed from other @PACKAGE@ daemons.

# Maximum value: 256
#
# Default: 5

# Time out waiting for data from remote @PACKAGE@ clients
#
# Default: 5

# This tells @PACKAGE@ on which IP address to listen. You can use IPv4/IPv6
# Adresses or host names. If using IPv6 addresses, make sure to enclose them in
# square brackets, e.g.
#
# [fe80::e2cb:4eff:feb7:2af5]
#
# At maximum 256 IP addresses can be specified, each separated by space.
#
# The listening port can be specified using a colon. If no port is specified,
# the default port 48621 is used.
#
# Example:
# listen=127.0.0.1:48621 [::1]:48621 host.example.com:48650
#
# Default: 0.0.0.0:48621
#listen=0.0.0.0:48621

# Controls whether remote @PACKAGE@ informations are authoritative,
# i.e. circumvent IP exclude checks.
#
# 0 - non-authoritative
# 1 - authoritative
#
# Default: 0
remote_authoritative=0

# Specify whether or not the local @PACKAGE@ daemon informs other @PACKAGE@
# daemons about IP addresses that reached above defined thresholds.
#
# 0 - do not inform
# 1 - do inform
#
# Default: 0
inform=0

# Specify which agents to inform. The syntax is identical to the listen
# directive above.
#
# Default: none
#inform_agent=

# How many times should @PACKAGE@ retry informing other @PACKAGE@' when they
# are unavailable.
#
# Default: 30
inform_retry=30

# The number seconds to wait before retry informing @PACKAGE@.
#
# After 'inform_retry * inform_retry_wait' seconds data not sent to remote
# @PACKAGE@'s will be discarded.
#
# Default 3
inform_retry_wait=3

# The CA PEM file. If more than one CA is used, they can be pasted in this
# file.
#
# Default none

# The server certificate.

# The server private key. If the private key is encrypted, @PACKAGE@ will
# prompt for the password.
#
# Default none

# The client certificate.
#
# Default none
#ssl_client_cert=

# The client private key. If the private key is encrypted, @PACKAGE@ will
# prompt for the password.
#
# Default none
#ssl_client_key=

# The action scrIPt. It will be called if
#
# a) action_threshold is reached in time_interval seconds.
#
# b) the host record is removed due to purging
#
#
# The action is invoked with the following options
#
# <IP_address> <occurrences> <new|remove> <origin>

# Make sure it has the execution bit set, i.e. chmod +x <action_scrIPt>
