.\" DESCRIPTION
.\"=========================================================
.SH DESCRIPTION
The syntax of the file is very strict. Options must be placed at the
very beginning of the line. It is not allowed to have leading spaces
in front of the option name. It is also not allowed to have the equal
sign surrounded by trailing or leading spaces, e.g.:
.sp 1
.nf
foo = bar
foo= bar
foo =bar
.fi
.sp 1
are all invalid configuration directives.
.P
Comments start with a \fB#\fR at the beginning of the line with no leading
space.
.P
Empty lines are ignored.
.P
Invoking \fB@PACKAGE@\fR with the \fB-t\fR option specified checks the
configuration file. It is recommended to run this command every time the
configuration file has been altered.
.\"=========================================================
.\" OPTIONS
.\"=========================================================
.SH OPTIONS
The following options are recognized:
.\" pidfile
.TP 5
.I pidfile
The location of the PID file. That is where \fB@PACKAGE@\fR writes the PID of
the daemon when run in daemon mode.
.sp 1
Default: @DEFAULT_PIDFILE@
.\" syslogfile
.TP
.I syslogfile
The location of the file to be monitored, i.e. the file that will be continuously
monitored for new lines which are matched against the regular expression (see
\fIregex\fR further down).
.sp 1
Default: /var/log/authlog
.\" action_threshold
.TP
.I action_threshold
The number of occurrences of a host until the action script will be called (see
also \fItime_interval\fR). In this context, the term occurrence refers to the
matching of the regular expression to a line in \fIlogfile\fR.
.sp 1
Default: 3
.\" time_interval
.TP
.I time_interval
The action script will be called if a host has \fIaction_threshold\fR
occurrences within this time span (in seconds).
.sp 1
Default: 60
.TP
.\" purge_after
.I purge_after
If a host has no more occurrences in the log file for \fIpurge_after\fR
seconds, it will be purged from memory. For each host that is purged, the
action script will be called (see also @PACKAGE@(@ADM_SECTION@)).
.sp 1
Default: 3600
.TP
.\" action
.I action
The file path to the action script. It will be called if \fIaction_threshold\fR
is reached or exceeded in \fItime_interval\fR seconds, or the offending host is
removed from memory due to purging.
.br
The action script is called with the following options
.sp 1
.ti 15
.nf
 <\fIip_address\fR> <\fIoccurrences\fR> \fInew\fR|\fIremove\fR <\fIorigin\fR>
.fi
.sp 1
The literal \fInew\fR is passed when a host meets the action threshold and time
interval criteria. The literal \fIremove\fR is passed when a host is purged
from memory.
.br
\fIorigin\fR is either the literal \fIlocalhost\fR if the host
appeared in the local \fIsyslog\fR file, or the IP address of the
.B @PACKAGE@
instance sending the offending host information.
.sp 1
Default: /bin/true
.\" exclude
.TP
.I exclude
File that contains IP addresses to be ignored by \fB@PACKAGE@\fR. The specified
file will be re-read upon \fISIGHUP\fR. See also
agentsmith_exclude(@FILE_SECTION@).
.sp 1
Default: none
.\" regex
.TP
.I regex
The regular expression used to identify the IP address of offending hosts. See
REGULAR EXPRESSION.
.sp 1
Default: Failed keyboard-interactive for [\\w ]+ from
([\\d]{1,3}\\.[\\d]{1,3}\\.[\\d]{1,3}\\.[\\d]{1,3})
.\"== Networking Options
.SS Networking Options
Options in this section are used to configure communication between 
.B @PACKAGE@
instances. Please note, that SSL has to be set up when network
communication is enabled, too (see SSL Configuration below).
.\" server
.TP 5
.I server
Enable the server mode of 
.B @PACKAGE@.
In server mode,
.B @PACKAGE@
allows other remote
.B @PACKAGE@
instances to trigger the local action script. A value of 1 (`one') enables the
server. A value of 0 (`zero') disables the server.
.br
If the server is enabled,
.B @PACKAGE@
requires
.I ssl_ca_cert,
.I ssl_server_cert,
and
.I ssl_server_key
to be set properly.
.sp 1
Default: 0
.\" maxinconnections
.TP
.I maxinconnections
The maximum concurrent connections allowed from remote
.B @PACKAGE@
instances. The maximum value is 256.
.sp 1
Default: 5
.\" server_timeout
.TP
.I server_timeout
Time to wait for data from remote
.B @PACKAGE@
instances in seconds.
.sp 1
Default: 5
.\" listen
.TP
.I listen
This tells 
.B @PACKAGE@
on which IP addresses to listen. IPv4/IPv6 Adresses and
host names can be used. IPv6 addresses have to be enclosed in square brackets,
e.g.
.sp 1
.ti 15
.nf
[fe80::e2cb:4eff:feb7:2af5]
.fi
.sp 1
At maximum 256 IP addresses can be specified, each separated by space. The
listening port can be specified using a colon. If no port is specified, the
default port 48621 is used (see also
.B EXAMPLE).
.br
Please note, that if a host name resolves to multiple IP addresses,
.B @PACKAGE@
tries to listen on all addresses resolved.
.sp 1
Default: 0.0.0.0:48621
.\" remote_authoritative
.TP
.I remote_authoritative
If set to 1 (`one')
.B @PACKAGE@
will not consult the exclusion file specified with
.I exclude
when receiving offending host information from remote
.B @PACKAGE@
instances. Setting this option to 0 (`zero') makes
.B @PACKAGE@
check offending hosts received from remote instances whether they are to be
ignored.
.sp 1
Default: 0
.\" inform
.TP
.I inform
If set to 1 (`one') let inform
.B @PACKAGE@
other
.B @PACKAGE@
instances about occurrences of offending hosts and thus trigger remote actions
scripts. It will only inform instances specified with the
.I inform_agent
options.
.P
Enabling this option requires also
.I ssl_ca_file,
.I ssl_client_cert,
and
.I ssl_client_key
to be set.
.sp 1
Default: 0
.\" inform_agent
.TP
.I inform_agent
A space separated list of IPv4/IPv6 addresses or host names to be informed
about offending hosts. The syntax is identical to the
.I listen
option above.
.sp 1
Default: none
.\" inform_retry
.TP
.I inform_retry
How many times
.B @PACKAGE@
should retry to connect a remote instance if it is not responding.
.sp 1
Default: 30
.\" inform_retry_wait
.TP
.I inform_retry_wait
How many seconds to wait between subsequent attempts to connect remote
.B @PACKAGE@
instances. If after
.I inform_retry
*
.I inform_retry_wait
seconds an instance cannot be connected, the data to be sent to this instance
is discarded.
.sp 1
Default: 3
.\" == SSL Configuration
.SS SSL Configuration
In order to communicate with remote instances,
.B @PACKAGE@
uses SSL for encryption and authentication. Network communication is not
possible without proper SSL certificates.
.TP 5
.I ssl_ca_file
Path to the file containing the Certificate Authority bundle in PEM format used
in Server and Inform Mode.
.sp 1
Default: none
.TP
.I ssl_server_cert
Path to the file containing the server certificate in PEM format.
.sp 1
Default: none
.TP
.I ssl_server_key
Path to the file containing the server private key in PEM format. Please note,
that if the key is encrypted
.B @PACKAGE@
will prompt for the password.
.sp 1
Default: none
.TP
.I ssl_client_cert
Path to the file containing the client certificate in PEM format.
.sp 1
Default: none
.TP
.I ssl_client_key
Path to the file containing the client private key in PEM format. Please not,
that if the key is encrypted
.B @PACKAGE@
will prompt for the password.
.sp 1
Default: none
.\"=========================================================
.\" REGULAR EXPRESSION
.\"=========================================================
.SH REGULAR EXPRESSION
\fB@PACKAGE@\fR uses Perl compatible regular expressions. The expression used
by \fB@PACKAGE@\fR may only contain one catching pattern \'(...)\' which has to
catch the IP address of the offending host. If alternations \'(...|...)\' have
to be used, they can be written as follows
.sp 1
.ti 15
.nf
(?:a|b)
.fi
.sp 1
Invoking \fB@PACKAGE@\fR with the \fB-t\fR option set will test the regular
expression for correctness as required by \fB@PACKAGE@\fR.
