# Action script for sending a mail if a break-in attempt has been detected.
#
# This is an example of an action script that can be used with @PACKAGE@. It is
# not very sophisticated, but should give a basic clue how to write more
# sophisticated scripts.
#
# Action scripts are called with the first command line argument set to the
# catching pattern of the regular expression (see @DEFAULT_CONFIGFILE@), the
# second command line argument set to the number of occurrences of the matches
# of the regular expression in the log file.
#
# The third command line argument tells the script whether the call is due to
# the host exceeds the action_threshold configured in the configuration file,
# or the record for this host is being removed due to the purge_after time. In
# the first case the value is 'new' in the second case 'remove'
#
# The fourth and last command line argument is the @PACKAGE@ instance which
# the break-in attempt has detected. It is the IP address of a remote
# @PACKAGE@ instance, or the literal 'localhost' if it originates from the
# local @PACKAGE@ instance.
