Installation Instruction
========================

The build and installation is pretty straight forward. First, call

    $ ./configure
    $ make
    $ make install

By default, the pid file used by the daemon will live in

   $LOCALSTATEDIR/sshsentinel/sshsentinel.pid

The default location of the configuration file is

    SYSCONFDIR/sshsentinel.conf

Those  location can  be  changed by  either specifying  --localstatedir=<PATH>,
--sysconfdir=<PATH>, --with-pid=<FILEPATH>, or --with-config=<FILEPATH>.

If the PCRE library cannot be found, make sure you set the proper CPPFLAGS, and 
LDFLAGS environment variable before calling configure, e.g. 

    $ export CPPFLAGS='-I/usr/local/include'
    $ export LDFLAGS='-L/usr/local/lib'

Further, ensure that  the development packages for PCRE  are installed, this is
especially important if you build sshsentinel on a Linux distribution.

That's all folks.

If more generic information, refer to INSTALL.generic.
