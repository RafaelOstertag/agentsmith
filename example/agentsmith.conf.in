# This is the configuration file for @PACKAGE@
#
# Comments start with '#'. Comments are only allowed at the start of the line.
# Configuration options ARE CASE-SENSITIVE.  Spaces between the configuration
# option and the equal sign ('=') are not allowed. E.g.:
#
# foo = bar
# foo= bar
# foo =bar
#
# are not allowed. The only way to do it is like this
#
# foo=bar
#
# If you run @PACKAGE@ with the -t switch, it will check the configuration and
# the regular expression. So, it is always a good idea to use -t switch after
# modifying the configuration file.

# The location of the pid file
pidfile=@DEFAULT_PIDFILE@

# The log file to monitor for break-in attempts.
syslogfile=/var/log/authlog

# How many occurrences in the log file before the action kicks in
#
# Default: 3
action_threshold=3

# Maximum time between subsequent matches in
# seconds. 'action_threshold' occurences of break-in attempts have to
# happen within this time interval
#
# Default: 60
time_interval=60

# Remove host records after this many seconds have elapsed (this
# should obviously be a value greater than time_interval)
#
# Default: 3600

# listed will be ignored, and the action script will not be called.

# Default: empty

# Enable the server mode. In server mode, agentsmith allows other agentsmith

# This tells agentsmith on which interfaces to listen. You can use IPv4/IPv6
# Adresses or host names. If using IPv6 addresses, make sure to enclose them in
# square brackets, e.g.
#
# [fe80::e2cb:4eff:feb7:2af5]
#
# There can be at maximum 256 listen directives, each separated by space.
#
# Syntax
#
# listen=<ipv4|hostname>[:port]|[<ipv6][:port] ...
#
# Example:
# listen=127.0.0.1:48621 [::1]:48621 host.example.com:48650
#
# Default: 0.0.0.0:48621
#listen=0.0.0.0:48621

# Specify whether or not the local agentsmith daemon informs other agentsmith
# daemons about ip addresses that reached above defined thresholds.
#
# 0 - do not inform
# 1 - do inform
#
# Default: 0
inform=0

# Controls whether remote agentsmith informations are authoritative,
# i.e. circumvent IP exclude checks.
#
# 0 - non-authoritative
# 1 - authoritative
#
# Default: 0
remote_authoritative=0

# Specify which agents to inform. The syntax is identical to the listen
# directive above.
#
# Default: none
#inform_agent=

# How many times should agentsmith retry informing other agentsmith' when they
# are unavailable.
#
# Default: 30
inform_retry=30

# The number seconds to wait before retry informing agentsmith.
#
# After 'inform_retry * inform_retry_wait' seconds data not sent to remote
# agentsmith's will be discarded.
#
# Default 3
