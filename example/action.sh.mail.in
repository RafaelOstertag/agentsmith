# This is an example of an action script that can be used with @PACKAGE@. It is
# not very sophisticated, but should give a basic clue how to write more
# sophisticated scripts.
#
# Action scripts are called with the first command line argument set to the
# catching pattern of the regular expression (see @DEFAULT_CONFIGFILE@), the
# second command line argument set to the number of occurrences of the matches
# of the regular expression in the logfile.
#
# The third and last command line argument tells the script whether the call is
# due to the host exceeds the action_threshold configured in the configuration
# file, or the record for this host is being removed due to the purge_after
# time. In the first case the value is 'new' in the second case 'remove'
