.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fB@PACKAGE@\fR [\fB\-c \fIconfigfile\fR] [\fB\-p \fIpidfile\fR] [\fB\-d\fR] [\fB\-h\fR|\fB\-t\fR|\fB\-L\fR|\fB\-V\fR]

.\"=========================================================
.\" DESCRIPTION
.\"=========================================================
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fB@PACKAGE@\fR is a daemon that continuously monitors a log file for break\-in
attempts by remote hosts. Upon detection of a break\-in attempt, it launches a
user defined script or application.
.P
The criteria what is considered a break-in attempt can be configured by means
of a regular expression. See @PACKAGE@.conf(@FILE_SECTION@) for further
information about this.
.\"=========================================================
.\" OPTIONS
.\"=========================================================
.SH OPTIONS
The following options are supported:
.\"
.IP "\fB\-c \fIconfigfile\fR"
File path of the configuration file to use. If not specified, the default
@DEFAULT_CONFIGFILE@ is used. See also @PACKAGE@.conf(@FILE_SECTION@).
.IP "\fB\-p \fIpidfile\fR"
File path of the file where the pid of the daemon will be written to. If not
specified, the default @DEFAULT_PIDFILE@ is used.
.IP "\fB\-d\fR"
Do not fork to background but stay in foreground. Most useful for debugging.
.IP "\fB\-h\fR"
Show a brief help of the supported options.
.IP "\fB\-t\fR"
Check the configuration file and regular expression, and exit.
.IP "\fB\-L\fR"
Show the license and exit.
.IP "\fB\-V\fR"
Show the version and exit.
.\"=========================================================
.\" USAGE
.\"=========================================================
.SH USAGE
\fB@PACKAGE@\fR reads the configuration at the default location (see FILES) or
at the location provided with the \fB-c\fR option when started. It is
recommended to launch \fB@PACKAGE@\fR with the \fB-t\fR option specified after
the configuration has been altered in order to identify possible configuration
errors.
.P
After successful start \fB@PACKAGE@\fR will fork to background (unless the
\fB-d\fR option is provided) and monitor the log file specified in the
configuration file. It will only read new linwa added to the log file. Lines
present in the log file prior starting \fB@PACKAGE@\fR are be ignored.
.P
Each new line added to the log file will be matched against the regular
expression specified in the configuration file. If a line matches,
\fB@PACKAGE@\fR will read the value from the catching expression which has to
be a host IP address. This IP address will then be remembered by
\fB@PACKAGE@\fR. If the host IP address exceeds the configured threshold of
occurrences within the specified time span, the action script will be called.
.P
The action script is only called once for each host that meets the above
mentioned criteria.
.P
If a IP address remembered by \fB@PACKAGE@\fR is not seen for a specified
amount of time, the action script will be called again and the IP address will
be purged from memory.
.P
\fB@PACKAGE@\fR uses no persistent storage for holding the host IP addresses,
thus the information is only kept during the run time of the process and is
lost upon termination.
.\"
.SS The Action Script
The action script is called in two cases:
.IP 1)
A host has triggered the action script as explained above. The script will be
invoked by \fB@PACKAGE@\fR with the following arguments:

.nf
<\fIipaddress\fR> <\fIoccurrences\fR> new <\fIsender\fR>
.fi

<\fIipaddress\fR> is the IP address of the offending host, i.e. the IP address
that has been catched by the regular expression.  <\fIoccurrences\fR> is the
umber of occurrences. The literal word 'new' is used to indicate that the call
of the action script is for a new host.  <\fIsender\fR> is the origin of the IP
address, i.e. the instance of agentsmith that encountered the IP address of the
offending host.
.IP 2)
A host entry will be purged from memory, due to user request or because it has
expired. In that case, the script will be invoked with the following arguments:

.nf
<\fIipaddress\fR> <\fIoccurrences\fR> remove <\fIsender\fR>
.fi

<\fIipaddress\fR>, <\fIoccurrences\fR>, and <\fIsender\fR> are the same as in case
1) however <\fIoccurrences\fR> may be higher (depending on the action that was
taken, i.e. the host has not been blocked by the action script). The literal
word 'remove' is used to indicate that the host will be purged from memory.
.P
The action script is the corner stone of \fB@PACKAGE@\fR. You are completely
free to put whatever you suit in this file, e.g. commands for updating firewall
rules, commands for sending mails, and so on.
.P
It is important that the execution bit is set (see also chmod(1)) and
\fB@PACKAGE@\fR has read and execution access to the file.
.\"=========================================================
.\" Inform Mode
.\"=========================================================
.SH 
.\"=========================================================
.\" Inform Mode
.\"=========================================================
.SS Inform Mode
\fB@PACKAGE@\fR can inform other agentsmith instances running on remote hosts
of break-in attempts detected.
.P
In order to provide authentication, \fB@PACKAGE\fR employs SSL.
.\"=========================================================
.\" Server Mode
.\"=========================================================
.SS Server Mode
\fB@PACKAGE@\fR can receive IP addresses to block from remote \fB@PACKAGE@\fR
instances. Upon receiving IP addresses from remote instances, the action script
of the receiving \fB@PACKAGE@\
.\"=========================================================
.\" CONFIGURATION
.\"=========================================================
.SH CONFIGURATION
\fB@PACKAGE@\fR relies on a configuration file for proper operation. The
default location of the configuration file is @DEFAULT_CONFIGFILE@. Please see
@PACKAGE@.conf(@FILE_SECTION@) for further information about how to configure
\fB@PACKAGE@\fR.
.\"=========================================================
.\" LOGGING
.\"=========================================================
.SH LOGGING
The logging facility used by \fB@PACKAGE@\fR is \fBdaemon\fR. Regular messages
are sent to \fBdaemon.info\fR. Error messages are sent to
\fBdaemon.error\fR. If \fB@PACKAGE@\fR is compiled with debug code, debug
messages are sent to \fBdaemon.debug\fR.
.P
You may need to adjust the configuration of the system logger in order to catch
all messages from \fB@PACKAGE@\fR. Please refer to syslog.conf(@FILE_SECTION@)
or your System Manual.
.\"=========================================================
.\" SIGNALS
.\"=========================================================
.SH SIGNALS
\fB@PACKAGE@\fR recognizes following signals (see also kill(1)).
.IP \fISIGHUP\fR
If an exclude file has been specified (see also
agentsmith_exclude(@FILE_SECTION@)), its content will be re-read.
.IP \fISIGUSR1\fR
Request the list of the hosts that have attempted to break\-in will be printed
to the system log (see also LOGGING).
.IP \fISIGUSR2\fR
Request that the known hosts are purged from the memory. This will also call
the action script with the 'remove' option.
.IP \fISIGTERM\fR
Terminate \fB@PACKAGE@\fR gracefully.
.\"=========================================================
.\" FILES
.\"=========================================================
.SH FILES
.IP \fI@DEFAULT_PIDFILE@\fR
The default file path of the pid file. Can be overridden with the \fB-p\fR
option.
.IP \fI@DEFAULT_CONFIGFILE@\fR
The default location of the configuration file. Can be override with the
\fB-c\fR option.
.\"=========================================================
.\" CAVEATS
.\"=========================================================
.SH CAVEATS
.IP *
Although calling \fB@PACKAGE@\fR with the \fB-t\fR option shows no error, it is
possible that \fB@PACKAGE@\fR does not start because it cannot write the pid
file. Please make sure you check the system log after starting \fB@PACKAGE@\fR
as daemon to make sure it started successfully.
.IP *
If started as root, \fB@PACKAGE@\fR does not drop root privileges.
.IP *
\fB@PACKAGE@\fR has to be started from an user account with read access to the
specified log file, else \fB@PACKAGE@\fR is unable to read the log file and
cannot start.
.IP *
Support for IPv6 addresses is implemented but not tested.
.IP *
If the log file is removed during the operation of \fB@PACKAGE@\fR, it will
repeatedly suspend for 30 seconds until the file reappears.
