# This is the configuration file for @PACKAGE@
#
# Comments start with '#'. Comments are only allowed at the start of the line.
# Configuration options ARE CASE-SENSITIVE.  Spaces between the configuration
# option and the equal sign ('=') are not allowed. E.g.:
#
# foo = bar
# foo= bar
# foo =bar
#
# are not allowed. The only way to do it is like this
#
# foo=bar
#
# If you run @PACKAGE@ with the -t switch, it will check the configuration and
# the regular expression. So, it is always a good idea to use -t switch after
# modifying the configuration file.

# The location of the pid file
pidfile=@DEFAULT_PIDFILE@

# The syslog log to read

# How many occurrences before the action kicks in
action_threshold=3

# Maximum time between subsequent matches in seconds
time_interval=60

# Remove host records after this many seconds (this should obviously be a value
# greater than time_interval)

# This file contains the IP Addresses and ranges to be excluded. All addresses
# listed will be ignored, and the action script will not be called.
#exclude=@sysconfdir@/agentsmith/exclude

# The action script. It will be called if 
#
# a) action_threshold is reached exceeded in time_interval seconds.
#
# b) the host record is removed due to purging
#
#
# The action is invoked with the following options
#
# <ip_address> <occurrences> <new|remove>
#
# Make sure it has the execution bit set, i.e. chmod +x <action_script>
action=@sysconfdir@/agentsmith/action/action.sh

# The (PERL) regular expression used to extract the ip addresses. Be aware, it
# may only contain one catching '(...)' pattern. If you need to use alternation
# '(...|...)' use '(?:...|...)'
