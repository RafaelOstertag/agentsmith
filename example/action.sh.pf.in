# Action script for adding/removing a pf rule on OpenBSD if a break-in attempt
# has been detected. The script expects a pf table named 'agentsmith' to
# exist.
#
# This is an example of an action script that can be used with @PACKAGE@. It is
# not very sophisticated, but should give a basic clue how to write more
# sophisticated scripts.
#
# Action scripts are called with the first command line argument set to the
# catching pattern of the regular expression (see @DEFAULT_CONFIGFILE@), the
# second command line argument set to the number of occurrences of the matches
# of the regular expression in the log file.
#
# The third command line argument tells the script whether the call is due to
# the host exceeds the action_threshold configured in the configuration file,
# or the record for this host is being removed due to the purge_after time. In
# the first case the value is 'new' in the second case 'remove'
#
# The fourth and last command line argument is the agentsmith instance the
# break-in attempt has been detected. It is the IP address of a remote
# agentsmith instance, or the literal 'localhost' if it originates from the
# local agentsmith instance.

HOSTNAME=`hostname`
TABLENAME=agentsmith
MAILTO=root

# If a host appears at least 'action_threshold' times
if [ "$3" = "new" ]
then
    pfctl -t "${TABLENAME}" -T add $1
    mail -s "Blocked access for $1 on ${HOSTNAME}" "${MAILTO}" <<EOF
I had to block access from $1 to $HOSTNAME because of $2 attempts with wrong use
rname/password.

Offending host's DNS record:
`host $1`

# If a host record is purged due to 'purge_after'
if [ "$3" = "remove" ]

    mail -s "Unblocked access for $1 on ${HOSTNAME}" "${MAILTO}" <<EOF
Access for $1 to $HOSTNAME has been unblocked.
