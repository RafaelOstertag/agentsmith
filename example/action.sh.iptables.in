# Action script for adding/removing an iptables rule on linux if a break-in
# attempt has been detected. The script expects a table named 'agentsmith' to
# exist.
#
# This is an example of an action script that can be used with @PACKAGE@. It is
# not very sophisticated, but should give a basic clue how to write more
# sophisticated scripts.
#
# Action scripts are called with the first command line argument set to the
# catching pattern of the regular expression (see @DEFAULT_CONFIGFILE@), the
# second command line argument set to the number of occurrences of the matches
# of the regular expression in the log file.
#
# The third and last command line argument tells the script whether the call is
# due to the host exceeds the action_threshold configured in the configuration
# file, or the record for this host is being removed due to the purge_after
# time. In the first case the value is 'new' in the second case 'remove'

# If a host appears at least 'action_threshold' times

    mail -s "Blocked access for $1 on ${HOSTNAME}" "${MAILTO}" <<EOF
